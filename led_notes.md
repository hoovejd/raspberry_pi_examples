## Blue LED Specs
* Max Forward/Continuous Current (If): 30 Milliampere (mA). You don't want to exceed this.
* Working Forward Current (IF): 20 Milliampere (mA). This is the current the LED should operate at.
* Forward Voltage (VF): typical 3.2 Volts (V)


## Red LED Specs
* Max Forward Current: 30 mA
* Working Forward Current: 20 mA
* Forward Voltage: 2.0 Volts (V)


## Determine Resistance
* Ohm's Law is V/I = R
* Using 5V of supply voltage (Vs) and the blue LED with a Vf of 3.2V and IF of 20mA (0.02A) our equation is (5V - 3.2V) / 0.02A = 90Î© (Ohm's)
